                The generative component of both applications is based on
                <strong>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)</strong> to combine
                search-based methods with generative AI models. Whilst
                search-based models can find relevant information from text,
                they cannot provide comprehensive answers in natural language.
                Conversely, whilst generative models can produce answers in
                natural language, these can be inaccurate without context. RAG
                addresses these limitations by leveraging the strengths of both
                approaches whilst minimising their weaknesses. With RAG, filters
                can first be applied to narrow down the documents. Relevant
                passages from the (filtered) documents are then identified using
                a machine learning model based on natural language input. The
                identified context is then sent to a generative AI model (in our
                case <strong>OpenAI GPT-4</strong>) together with the original
                input.

                <strong>Limitations</strong>: As part of our transparency
                efforts, we acknowledge certain limitations of our current
                system. Without appropriate filters, there may be less accurate
                responses. Additionally, like all generative AI systems, our
                tool may occasionally produce inaccurate information. Due to
                processing capacity constraints, not all documents can be
                considered simultaneously for each query, which may limit the
                comprehensiveness of responses. These limitations are inherent
                to current generative AI technology and affect similar systems
                across the field.

                The initial NegotiateAI prototype has already shown strong
                potential to improve negotiation processes and has laid the
                foundation for broader adoption. Building on this, our current
                focus is on delivering
                <strong>precise, evidence-based analyses</strong> of treaty
                submissions. Our goal is to help Delegations navigate the
                growing volume of unstructured information through
                <strong>targeted, efficient, and in-depth analysis</strong>. The
                latest features help users navigate and understand the
                submissions more effectively â€“
                <strong

                  of States and topics</strong

                more accessible than ever.

                Looking ahead, our role beyond the INC negotiation process
                remains open: whether by continuously refining the app to
                increase transparency and trace the evolution of the draft
                treaty text, or by developing new tools to help countries align
                treaty obligations with their national legal systems. As the
                final scope of the treaty is still undecided, so too is the
                exact direction of our future involvement. But one thing is
                certain: we are committed to
                <strong>developing relevant, practical tools</strong> that
                continue to support implementation even once a treaty is in
                place and has been ratified.

                  The United Nations has embarked on a monumental task:
                  negotiating a legally binding agreement to tackle the global
                  plastic pollution crisis. The goal is to establish a robust
                  framework that ends plastic pollution and promotes sustainable
                  production and consumption of plastic worldwide.

                  Representatives from <strong>around 180 countries</strong> are
                  involved in this extensive process. The resolution to
                  elaborate such a legally binding instrument was adopted in
                  March 2022 at the
                  <strong>UN Environment Assembly (UNEA-5.2)</strong> in
                  Nairobi. Between 2022 and 2024,
                  <strong>five negotiation rounds</strong> took place. While the
                  fifth session (INC-5) in Busan, Republic of Korea, was
                  intended to be the final round, it ended without agreement on
                  a treaty text â€“ leaving key issues unresolved and the treaty
                  still under negotiation. As a result, the process was
                  adjourned and the urgently needed continuation of talks has
                  now been scheduled for
                  <strong>INC-5.2, taking place in Geneva in August 2025</strong
                  >. This upcoming session will be critical to bridging
                  remaining gaps and paving the way towards a final agreement.

                  The urgent need for a treaty arises from the

                    oceans yearly</strong

                  <strong>tripling by 2060 compared to 2019</strong> without
                  intervention, as an OECD study predicts. Plastic production,
                  heavily reliant on fossil fuels and toxic additives, threatens
                  both the environment and human health.

                  especially helpful for smaller Delegations with limited
                  resources to participate more effectively. Our goal is to make
